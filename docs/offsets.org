* Offsets

This document should contain most of the offsets I found myself and have collected from other resources.
Each save entry should be seperated by ~0x800~.

** General information

| Name                          | Offset | Length (bytes) |
|-------------------------------+--------+----------------|
| Distance between save entries |  0x800 |                |
| End of first save             |  0x7FD |                |
| Checksum                      |  0x7FE |              2 |
| Player's location             |  0x726 |              2 |
| Luc (money)                   |  0x491 |              3 |
| End of header                 |   0x6F |                |

** Header

The header contains the information you see on the save select screen in the game.
Each save entry has its own header. Information for all three characters are stored
in the header if they are unlocked in the game, seperated by ~0x20~. That's why I only
documented the first character, since you just add ~0x20~ to go to the next character.

The only exception is the current music. This is stored in the header section, but is not only
information shown and actually used in the gameplay.

** Save data

The distance between each character here is ~0xff~. The stats like "Current HP", "Max HP" will assume
that the first character will be edited. If you want to edit another character, add up ~0xff~.
All characters will be covered if this is not the case.
